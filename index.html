               <div class="image">Any hobby that I may have pursued in times past has now been replaced by my pandemic puppy, Sookie. She was born to a stray mother dog who had been rescued by Southern Nevada Animal Rescue League and I took over her care at 8 weeks old, just after her first rounds of vaccines. It has gone far easier than expected and I feel so lucky for that. She potty-trained herself on day one. All I did is show her where to go. We are now doing basic training, where everything is going fairly-well. In fact, it has been fantastic, but I temper that with the knowledge that she is still a baby and has not begun testing boundaries or teething. Also, she is on track to weight over 70 pounds as an adult. BIG GIRL! Check back for updates!</div>
